- Use polars_ds for traditional machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- Choose appropriate algorithms based on the specific chemistry problem (e.g., regression, classification, clustering).
- Implement proper hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.
- Use cross-validation techniques suitable for chemical data (e.g., scaffold split for drug discovery tasks).
- Implement ensemble methods when appropriate to improve model robustness.
